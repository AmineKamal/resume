To the human resources manager.

Hello,

Itâ€™s with enthusiasm that I respond to your ad via the glassdoor website. I recently
graduated with a bachelor degree in software engineering at the polytechnic school and I am strongly interested in the Full Stack Engineer position that you offer.

The experience brought by my first internship in quality assurance, my second and third internship as a
software developer as well as my previous jobs have given me several advantages
relevant to the position. In particular, a rigor and a discipline in all the tasks that I had to
do and an ease to deal with problems in very short times.

Being  a resourceful, dynamic and organized person in my work, these qualities make
me someone who has the ability to learn and assimilate information and therefore a candidate
ideal for the job you offer.

A more detailed view of my technical skills can be found on my resume (pdf version or website).

It will be my pleasure to discuss in more depth with you my formation and experience as soon as
the time is right for you. You can contact me at (514) 661-0893 or by
email to my email address: m.amine.kamal@outlook.com.

Looking forward to speaking with you,
Amine Kamal
